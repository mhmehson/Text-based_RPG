# Text-based_RPG
Semester-long project from Software Design I

Summary: 
This project is a simple text-based RPG-style game in which the user/player customizes the character 
by selecting a name and other attributes. Once created, the user must navigate the character through 
a castle by selecting to go north, south, east, or west. The player may encounter monsters while navigating 
through the rooms in the castle. The player must battle and defeat these monsters in order to continue 
playing the game. The character receives “power-ups” after defeating the monster. The player may quit 
playing anytime he/she is not battling a monster.
